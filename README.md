# My NoSQL Social Network API

## Description

This is an API created using Mongoose and Express.js packages for a social network web app where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list.  

## Choice of Tools

### MongoDB

We use [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/), the popular data platform for many social networks because of its speed and ability to handle large amounts of data, as well as flexibility with unstructured data. The purpose of this project is to understand how to create and structure an API for popular social networking platforms. Since the foundation of full-stack applications for many social networking platforms is **data**, it’s important we understand how to build the API first.

## Walkthrough Video

This is the backend of an application, therefore will not be deployed. Here is the [link]() to a walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the app.
